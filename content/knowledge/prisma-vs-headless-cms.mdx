# Prisma vs headless CMS for a knowledge graph

**Prisma** is an ORM and schema layer.  
**Headless CMS** is a **content product** on top of a database, plus infra and editing UI.

You can build your knowledge graph both ways, but the trade offs are different.

---

## Flow with Prisma only

### Data model

- `Concept` table  
- `ConceptLink` table  
- Optional `Tag` table

You own the schema and how concepts and edges are stored.

### System flow

- **Graph rendering**  
  Next.js route (server component) → `prisma.concept.findMany()` + `prisma.conceptLink.findMany()` → build in-memory graph → render 3D visual.

- **Concept page**  
  `/knowledge/[slug]` → `prisma.concept.findUnique({ where: { slug } })` + its links → render node + neighbours.

- **Editing**  
  You build your own internal admin UI:  
  form → API route → `prisma.concept.create/update()` → DB.

### Pros

- Maximum control over schema and queries  
- Easy to integrate with other app features (auth, progress tracking, analytics)  
- Simple to move or extend later

### Trade offs

- You must build:
  - Forms and editor  
  - Auth and roles  
  - Drafts / versioning if you want them  
- More upfront work if content volume becomes large

---

## Flow with a headless CMS

A headless CMS is a **content layer over a database**:

- Built-in admin UI  
- Rich text, media, roles, drafts, versions  
- You consume content via **REST or GraphQL** from Next.js

### System flow

- **Authoring**  
  You in browser → CMS admin UI → create / edit concept + links → CMS writes to DB.

- **Graph rendering**  
  `/knowledge` → fetch all concepts and links via CMS API → build graph → 3D visual.

- **Concept page**  
  `/knowledge/[slug]` → fetch concept by slug + related concepts from CMS → render.

### Pros

- Polished editing UI on day one  
- Content validation, version history, drafts, media uploads provided  
- Good for **multi-user**, public/private nodes, collaboration

### Trade offs

- Tied to CMS data model and upgrade path  
- Local development heavier than pure Prisma + Postgres  
- Some constraints around how you query and shape content

---

## Summary

- Use **Prisma only** if you want **maximum control** and are happy coding the editor.  
- Use a **headless CMS** if you want **great UX for writing** and might support other users later.

Your current phase (solo, file-first, personal brain) fits **files → Prisma later**, then a CMS only if you start collaborative or public knowledge work.
