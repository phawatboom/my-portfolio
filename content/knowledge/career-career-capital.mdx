## Concept

Career capital is the accumulation of rare and valuable skills. It is the currency you use to buy autonomy and impact.

## My Strategy

- **T-Shaped Skills**: Deep expertise in one area (Software/AI) with broad knowledge in others (Finance, Trading).
- **Show Your Work**: Publicly demonstrating capability through projects and writing.
