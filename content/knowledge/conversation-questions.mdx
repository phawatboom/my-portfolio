# Conversation questions: light, middle, deep

A simple structure for moving from **safe small talk** to **real connection**.

---

## Light questions

Warm up, low risk, easy to answer.

- What has been the best moment of your life so far?  
- If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be?  
- What is the most interesting place you have ever visited?  
- What is one of your first or best childhood memories?

---

## Middle questions

More personal, but still comfortable for most people.

- If you could have any superpower for a day, what would it be and why?  
- What is the funniest or most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to you?  
- If you could become an expert in anything, what would it be?  
- What do you value most in a friendship?  
- Are you working on any exciting projects at the moment?  
- If you could travel anywhere right now, where would you go?  
- What is a lesson you have learned that you think everyone should know?

## Deep questions

Used when there is already some trust.

- What is a challenge you have faced recently and how did you handle it?  
- Have your goals or ambitions changed much over the year?  
- What is something you have learned about yourself over the past year?

These questions help you move from **surface level** to **real conversations** without jumping too fast.
