## Core Philosophy

Trading is not about predicting the future, but about identifying when the odds are in your favor.

## Key Pillars

- **Order Flow**: Understanding the mechanism of price discovery.
- **Risk Management**: Survival is the prerequisite for success.
- **Systematic Execution**: Removing emotional bias from decision making.
