# Career, interviews, and signalling

A lot of career outcomes are about **signals**: how you present competence, warmth, and fit.

---

## Before the interview

- Research the company, role, and interviewer if possible  
  → shows you are serious and respectful of their time  
- Dress **one step better** than what is typical for the role  
- Prepare **STAR stories** with numbers and clear impact  
- Avoid oversharing personal problems or badmouthing previous employers

---

## During the interview

- Small talk and first impression matter: greet everyone politely, even security and reception  
- Body language: open posture, no hands buried in pockets, match handshake grip and energy  
- Aim to be **clear and concise** rather than fast and chaotic  
  - What? (the answer)  
  - So what? (impact)  
  - Now what? (what you learned, what you would do next)

Avoid:

- Dumping your entire life story  
- Showing desperation (“I really need this job”)  
- Revealing previous salaries early unless strategic

---

## Recruiters and fit

- Recruiters look for **fit with the team**, not just raw IQ  
- Your CV and LinkedIn should highlight:
  - Results, not just responsibilities  
  - Keywords that match the role  
- Top candidates get offers quickly: speed and preparation matter

---

## Negotiation and raises (high level)

- Prepare a **BATNA** (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)  
- Focus on **interests, not positions**  
- Use **objective criteria** (market ranges, your contribution)  
- Ask **good questions**:
  - “If you were me, how would you evaluate this offer?”  
  - “What gaps do you still see between my profile and the role?”

Salary is more negotiable when:

- You have built strong relationships  
- You deliver skills they do not have  
- You can show you already created value

Your personal brand is a mix of **reputation, trust, and attention**.  
Interviews, LinkedIn, and your website are all different surfaces of the same thing.
