# Life principles: discipline, focus, and what matters

A set of ideas that shape how to live a life you will not regret later.

---

## Beliefs and boundaries

- **Belief defines your borderlines**  
  What you believe you can or cannot do quietly sets your limits.

- **Confidence comes from doing hard things**  
  Not from words, but from surviving challenges and distractions.

- **Focus is knowing what to ignore**  
  Successful people focus on the most important thing and accept that other things wait.

- **Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.**

## Not living for external validation

- If you care too much about others’ opinions, you become their prisoner.  
- Social media can reward fake perfection and external validation.  
- Real life is not a highlight reel. It is work, rest, people, and trade offs.

---

## Money and lifestyle

- You must **spend less than you earn** consistently.  
- Money is like air: when you have enough, you do not think about it; when you are always gasping, you think of nothing else.  
- A good life balances **what you have to do** and **what you want to do**, not an artificial “work vs life” split (work–life harmony).

## Action and failure

- Many people are paralysed by fear of failure.  
- If the downside is acceptable, **taking action is usually worth it**.  
- You do not need to win every argument. You do need to keep moving forward.

## Reflection questions

- If your life was a documentary or a book, how would your audience feel watching it?  
- Are you living in a way that your future self will respect, or regret?  
- Are you investing deeply in the people and projects that actually matter to you?
