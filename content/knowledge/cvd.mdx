# Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD)

CVD tracks whether **aggressive buyers or aggressive sellers** are dominating over time.  
It accumulates:

> market buy volume − market sell volume

so it shows the **pressure behind the move**, not just the price path.

---

## Core idea

- **Price up + CVD up** → real buying pressure, move is supported by aggressive buyers  
- **Price down + CVD down** → real selling pressure, move is supported by aggressive sellers  
- **Price and CVD diverge** → move is often **weak, tired, or manipulated**

CVD tells you **who is actually hitting the market**, not just where candles closed.

## How traders use CVD

### 1. Trend confirmation

- Price up, CVD rising strongly → trend has real participation  
- Price up, CVD flat or falling → move often weak, short covering, or thin liquidity

### 2. Divergence detection

- Price makes a **higher high**, CVD makes a **lower high**  
  → aggressive buyers are **less committed**, trend may be near exhaustion  
- Price makes a **lower low**, CVD makes a **higher low**  
  → sellers are losing steam, potential reversal or squeeze

### 3. Spotting absorption

- **Big CVD push, flat price, visible resting liquidity**  
  → large passive orders are absorbing all the aggression  
  → often precedes a sharp reversal when aggressors run out of bullets

### 4. Breakout quality check

- Clean breakout + CVD spike in the breakout direction  
  → higher quality breakout, real participation  
- Breakout with **flat or opposite CVD**  
  → high chance of **fakeout**, liquidity grab, or stop run

### 5. Demand / supply zones

At a support or demand zone:

- Price retests level, **CVD turns upward early**  
  → buyers quietly step in, zone likely to hold  
- Price retests level, **CVD stays flat or drops**  
  → no real interest, zone is weak and more likely to fail

## Summary

CVD is a **bridge between price and volume**:

- Price shows the outcome  
- CVD shows **who pushed it there**

Used well, it helps you filter breakouts, identify tired trends, and see where big players are absorbing or stepping in.
