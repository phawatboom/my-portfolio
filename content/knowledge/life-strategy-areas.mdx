# Life strategy and strategic life areas

Think of your life as a **portfolio of strategic units** rather than one blurry block.  
Each area has two scores:

- **Importance** (/10)  
- **Satisfaction** (/10)

High importance + low satisfaction → **priority areas** for change.

## Example strategic life areas

- **Relationships**  
  - Significant other  
  - Family  
  - Friends  

- **Body, mind, spirituality**  
  - Physical health / sports  
  - Mental health / mindfulness  
  - Spirituality / faith  

- **Community and society**  
  - Community / citizenship  
  - Societal engagement  

- **Job, learning, finances**  
  - Job / career  
  - Education / learning  
  - Finances  

- **Interests and entertainment**  
  - Hobbies / interests  
  - Online entertainment  
  - Offline entertainment  

- **Personal care**  
  - Physiological needs  
  - Daily living activities

You can rate each area, then ask:

- Where am I investing a lot of time but satisfaction is low?  
- Where do I say “this matters” but behaviours do not match?

## Life strategy idea

A **great life** is built by:

- A clear **vision and purpose**  
- A portfolio of life areas that match your values  
- Continuous small adjustments (preparation meets opportunity)

You want to spend more time in the **top-right corner**:  
high importance, high satisfaction, on purpose.
