> ATR measures **how much price typically moves per bar**, based on recent volatility.  
> It says nothing about direction, only **range**.

## Essence

- Volatility indicator, not a trend detector  
- Built from **True Range (TR)** per bar  
- Usually uses a 14-bar moving average of TR  
- Higher ATR ⇒ higher volatility, wider swings

## How ATR is calculated

**True Range (TR) for each bar**

Take the maximum of:

- `high - low`
- `|high - previous close|`
- `|low - previous close|`

**ATR**

- ATR is a moving average of TR over a chosen period (often 14 bars)
- As volatility rises, TR and ATR both increase  
- When markets calm down, ATR contracts

## What ATR tells you

### 1. Volatility range

- ATR ≈ “typical range per bar”
- Helps you anchor expectations like “a normal bar recently is about _X_ points wide”

### 2. Stop loss placement

Common rule of thumb:

- Long: stop at `entry - (1–2 × ATR)`
- Short: stop at `entry + (1–2 × ATR)`

This adapts the stop to **current volatility** instead of a fixed number of points.

### 3. Position sizing

Define **risk per trade** using ATR.

- High ATR (wild market) ⇒ **reduce size**  
- Low ATR (quiet market) ⇒ **you can take larger size for the same risk**

### 4. Breakout strength

- Breakout + **ATR spike** ⇒ move has **real volatility and participation**
- Breakout with **flat / falling ATR** ⇒ more likely a fakeout or range noise

### 5. Mean reversion vs trend timing

- Long quiet periods with **low ATR** often come **before** big trend expansions  
- Very high ATR often shows **late trend stress** or capitulation, where reversals or slowdowns become more likely
