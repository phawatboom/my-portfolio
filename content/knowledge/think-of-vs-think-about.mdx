# "Think of" vs "think about"

Both are correct, but they signal **different depth and focus**.

---

## Think of

**“Think of”** is used for a **quick judgment, reaction, or specific object**.

- “What do you think of this coin?”  
  → quick opinion about *this one specific coin*  
- “When you think of risk, what comes to mind?”  
  → asking for a few key associations

It narrows attention to a **single target**.

---

## Think about

**“Think about”** implies **deeper reflection or analysis**.

- “What do you think about crypto as part of a long term portfolio?”  
  → broader reasoning, pros and cons, context  
- “I need to think about this career offer.”  
  → sit with it, reflect, maybe analyse trade offs

It opens a **wider topic**, not just an instant reaction.

---

## Simple rule of thumb

- Use **think of** for **snap impressions** and **concrete things**.  
- Use **think about** for **reasoning, reflection, and bigger questions**.
