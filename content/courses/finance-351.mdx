- Discounted cash flow valuation  
- Enterprise value vs equity value  
- Dividend discount models  
- Comparable company valuation  
- Cost of capital, CAPM, betas and WACC  
- Foreign exchange, CIP/UIP, currency risk  
- International capital budgeting  
- Capital structure theories  
- Dividend and payout policy  
- Raising capital and IPO/SEO mechanics  
- Mergers and acquisitions  
- EPS impact, synergies and valuation in M&A

## Key Things I Learned

### **1. How to value a firm properly**
I learned to compute:
- Free cash flow (CFO – CAPEX – ΔOWC)  
- Enterprise value and equity value  
- Terminal value  
- Per share valuation  
- DDM- and DCF-based estimates  
- Market multiples with industry regressions  

The revision sheet highlights the importance of **net debt** and incremental cash flows when applying NPV and IRR rules (T2 topics).

### **2. How to estimate the cost of capital**
We practiced:
- Estimating levered/unlevered betas  
- Using comparables to infer project betas  
- CAPM, Brennan-Lally, and Fama-French cost of equity  
- Cost of debt from yields or debt betas  
- After-tax WACC for firm valuation  

Exercises in the exam solutions (e.g., Q15) covered beta unlevering/relevering and WACC construction.

### **3. How exchange rates affect valuation**
I learned FX mechanics:
- Spot, forward, bid-ask spreads  
- Triangular arbitrage  
- Covered and uncovered interest parity  
- Hedging foreign currency exposures  
- Pricing overseas projects in integrated vs segmented markets  
- Political and sovereign risks in valuation  

These appear under T4.1 and T4.2 in the topic list.

---

### **4. How capital structure affects firm value**
We studied:
- MM propositions (with and without taxes)  
- Interest tax shields  
- Financial distress costs  
- Trade-off theory  
- Pecking order theory  
- Agency issues like asset substitution and debt overhang  

The course emphasised how capital structure choices change equity beta, WACC, and firm value (T5 topics).

---

### **5. How dividends, buybacks, and financing decisions matter**
I learned:
- Dividend irrelevance under perfect markets  
- Home-made leverage and home-made dividends  
- Dividend imputation and tax clienteles in NZ  
- Dividend smoothing and signalling  
- Repurchase signalling  
- IPO pricing, winner’s curse, bookbuilding  
- Rights issues vs SEOs  

These topics form T6 and T7 in the topic list.

---

### **6. Mergers and acquisitions: value, synergies, EPS effects**
The course covered:
- What is acquired (assets vs shares)  
- Payment methods (cash vs shares)  
- Synergy sources and who captures value  
- Expected EPS changes  
- Acquisition premia  

This ties into T8 in the revision sheet.

## Practical Work & Problem Solving

### **Valuation calculations**  
Using real numbers (e.g., Q13–15), I practiced:
- Projecting FCF using revenue growth and OWC ratios  
- EV/EBITDA comps to price firms  
- Equity value and per-share estimation  
- ΔOWC adjustments  
- Cash-flow impact of asset sales  
- Unlevering and relevering betas  
- WACC construction from scratch  

These exercises strengthened my ability to apply frameworks in realistic scenarios.

## How I Apply This Today
The course directly supports my work in:
- Capital Compass valuation models  
- DCF components in my stock analysis platform  
- WACC and beta estimation in trading and investment use cases  
- International project evaluation  
- Corporate finance analytics for consulting/case competitions  

It ties strongly into my finance and software integration projects.
